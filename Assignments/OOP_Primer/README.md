## Definitions

#### Abstraction
>One of the principals of object oriented programming. To show the important parts of the code to the user.

#### Attributes / Properties
>The things a class does to differentiate from other classes

#### Class
>A user defined data type that is private by default. Can store member variables and functions.

#### Class Variable 
>A variable like a string or int that is stored in a class.

#### Composition
>The coding paradigm that a larger class is created via several smaller classes. Think of how a car is composed of tires, doors, engine, transmision, etc.

#### Constructor
>runs when an object of a class is created. A default constructor is used in most if not all classes but it is extremely useful when overloaded.

#### Encapsulation
>Similar to Abstraction the idea is to hide unimportant code from the user.

#### Friends
>A keyword used in classes that gives another class access to all member functions and variables no matter their level of security.

#### Inheritance 
>Whenever a class is a child of another class it is given access to its parent class's public and protected members.

#### Instance Variable
>Also known as objects, an instance variable is the user defined variable of type "class"

#### Member Variable
>A variable that is declared in a class. Whenever an object is created and the contructor runs is when the vaariables are actually created in memory.

#### Method
>A function that is defined in a class. Can only be used by the class that the function is created in or other classes that have access to the class's function 
>depending on its security level

#### Overloading
>When you redefine a class or function with different parameters that is called overloading.

#### Polymorphism
>"polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function." 

#### Public/Private/Protected
> Public: is available to anything ouside of the class
> Private: available only via members of the class like functions or if the friend keyword is used
> Protected: Like private but also grants access to child classes

#### Static
>A keyword that makes the variable used for the lifetime of a program even if the function is called multiple times.

#### Virtual
>A keyword that basically tells the compiler that the function or class affiliated will be overridden at some point
